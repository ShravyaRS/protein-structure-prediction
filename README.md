# 🧬 Protein Structure Prediction and Mutation Impact Analysis

## 🔍 Overview
This project provides an integrated pipeline for predicting 3D structures of proteins using **AlphaFold2** and analyzing the impact of **mutations** on structure, function, and druggability.  

It includes:
- Structure prediction using AlphaFold2
- Comparison with known PDB structures
- Interactive 3D visualization
- Functional hotspot annotation
- Mutation modeling and RMSD scoring

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Build reproducible pipelines for structure prediction
- Highlight mutation-induced structural disruptions
- Map functional regions (active sites, PTMs, etc.)
- Quantify changes via RMSD, TM-score, and energy shifts
